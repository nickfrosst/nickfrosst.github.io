I worked on neural network reserach there for 3 years, focusing on capsule networks, adversarial examples, and explanability.\nCurrently I am working on something somewhat secret. Please get in touch if you are looking for work and are interesting in big neural nets for language.\nI sing in an indie pop rock band called Good Kid. We play toronto frequently, and elsewhere occasionaly including LA and New York.\nI did my undergrad in Computer Science and Cognitive Science at U of T. During this time I had the chance to do research with John Tsotsos, Sonja Fidler, Jimmy Ba, John Vervaeke, Orion Buske, and Gary Baumgartner.\nIf you are curious about the birds, see this\n"});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/docs/other_art/','title':"other art",'content':"I run a bi-monthly sea shanty night at the imperial pub.
