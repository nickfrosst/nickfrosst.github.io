I enjoy teaching and am actively trying to improve at it. So I normally say yes when someone asks me to speak. I have given guest lectures at U of T, Ryerson, and York University at the graduate and undergradute level. I have spoken at the Toronto Machine Learning Summit, Re.Work AI conference, Start AI, Scotia Bank learning days, and others. 

Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfSxYqU-6s0&t=1s&ab_channel=TowardsDataScience) of a talk I gave recently.
