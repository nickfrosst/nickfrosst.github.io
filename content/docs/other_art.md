I run a quarterly sea shanty night at the Noonan's Irish Pub. We drink beer and sing old songs. All are welcome. If you are interested please join our [mailing list ](forms.gle/Mum8nGJAtxSX35e29).

I am interested in 3d photography, and work with the nishika n8000 camera to create wiggle grams which I post on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nick_frosst/?hl=en).
