I run a bi-monthly sea shanty night at the imperial pub. We drink beer and sing old songs. All are welcome. If you are interested please join our [mailing list ](https://mailchi.mp/66b99f0f80b6/shanty).

I am interested in 3d photography, and work with the nishika n8000 camera to create wiggle grams which I post on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nick_frosst/?hl=en).

I am an avid gunpla builder. These I post nowhere. I am not good at it, and dont plan on improving.
