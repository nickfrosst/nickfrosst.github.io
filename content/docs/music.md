I play in an indie pop rock band called Good Kid. We play fast paced good time music :) We recently released our second EP and it is available on all streaming platforms and for free download on bandcamp.

I am very interested in irish music and session singing and fiddle playing, but i am not very good. I have really enjoyed learning.
