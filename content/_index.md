I am a [computer scientist](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=1yVnaTgAAAAJ&hl=en) and [musician](https://open.spotify.com/artist/38SKxCyfrmNWqWunb9wGHP). 

I co-founded [Cohere](https://cohere.ai/) with Aidan Gomez and Ivan Zhang. We train large language models and make them available through a network based API. You can try it out [here](https://os.cohere.ai/playground/).   

I was the first employee of [Geoffrey Hinton](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/)'s Google Brain lab in Toronto. I worked on machine learning research there for 3 years, focusing on capsule networks, adversarial examples, and explainability. 

I did my undergrad in Computer Science and Cognitive Science at U of T. During this time I had the chance to work with [John Tsotsos](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~tsotsos/Tsotsos/Home.html), [Sanja Fidler](https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~fidler/), [Jimmy Ba](https://jimmylba.github.io/), [John Vervaeke](https://cwsl.ca/team-view/john-vervaeke/), [Orion Buske](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~buske/), and [Gary Baumgartner](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gfb/).
