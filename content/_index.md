I am a computer scientist working on neural networks, and a musician playing in an indie pop rock band.

I was the first employee of Geoffrey Hinton's Google Brain lab in Toronto. I worked on neural network reserach there for 3 years, focusing on capsule networks, adversarial examples, and explanability. 

Currently I am working on something somewhat [secret](https://secant.ai/). Please get in touch if you are looking for work and are interesting in big neural nets for language. 

I sing in an indie pop rock band called Good Kid. We play toronto frequently, and elsewhere occasionaly including LA and New York.

I did my undergrad in Computer Science and Cognitive Science at U of T. During this time I had the chance to do research with John Tsotsos, Sonja Fidler, Jimmy Ba, John Vervaeke, Orion Buske, and Gary Baumgartner.
