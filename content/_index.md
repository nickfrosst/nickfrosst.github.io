I am a computer scientist and musician. I work on [neural networks](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=1yVnaTgAAAAJ&hl=en), and play in an [indie pop rock band](https://open.spotify.com/artist/38SKxCyfrmNWqWunb9wGHP).

I was the first employee of [Geoffrey Hinton](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/)'s Google Brain lab in Toronto. I worked on machine learning reserach there for 3 years, focusing on capsule networks, adversarial examples, and explanability. 

Currently I am working on something somewhat [secret](https://secant.ai/). Please get in touch if you are looking for work and are interested in big neural nets for language. 

I sing in an indie pop rock band called Good Kid. We play toronto frequently, and elsewhere occasionaly.

I did my undergrad in Computer Science and Cognitive Science at U of T. During this time I had the chance to do research with [John Tsotsos](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~tsotsos/Tsotsos/Home.html), [Sonja Fidler](https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~fidler/), [Jimmy Ba](https://jimmylba.github.io/), [John Vervaeke](https://cwsl.ca/team-view/john-vervaeke/), [Orion Buske](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~buske/), and [Gary Baumgartner].(http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gfb/)
